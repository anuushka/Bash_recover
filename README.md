# Bash basics
[] : Basic Conditional expressions.if [ -f $file ]; then echo “The file exists”

[[]] : Conditional expressions. Provides more advanced features than [], such as pattern matching and logical operators. if [[ $string == “linux” ]]; then echo “The string is linux”

(): Run commands in a subshell environment. (cd /home/user/directory && ls)

(()) : Arithmetic operations. if (( $a + $b > $c )); then echo “The sum of a and b is greater than c”

Numeric comparison: -eq -lt -gt -ne -ge -le 

String comparison: ==

# Commands

cut - slices a line and extracts the section. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cut-command-linux-examples/

head - The head command, as the name implies, print the top N number of data of the given input. By default, it prints the first 10 lines of the specified files. If more than one file name is provided then data from each file is preceded by its file name. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/head-command-linux-examples/

tail - opposite of head

tr - delete, translate(replace)
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tr-command-in-unix-linux-with-examples/?ref=lbp

sort - to sort lines, not space separated words
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-command-linuxunix-examples/

uniq -  detect duplicate lines and also deletes the duplicate lines, not space separated words https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/uniq-command-in-linux-with-examples/

paste - join files horizontally (parallel merging) by outputting lines consisting of lines from each file specified, separated by tab as delimiter, to the standard output. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/paste-command-in-linux-with-examples/

# grep
-E allows greping several words with " | " 
-w allows greping whole words "the, that, then, those" not substring of a large word "otherwise"
-i allows case insensitive 
-v greps that don't contain the pattern

# sed
It can perform lots of functions on file like searching, find and replace, insertion or deletion. Though most common use of SED command in UNIX is for substitution or for find and replace. 

's' : substitutes the first occurence in each line

's' /g : substitutes all occurences in each line

's' /2 : substitutes the second occurence

\b: Word boundary, ensuring that "word" is a whole word, not part of another word.

-e : -e option to run multiple sed commands in a single sed command. 

/p : print flag prints the replaced line twice on the terminal

-n option along with the /p print flag to display only the replaced lines. -n suppresses the duplicate rows generated by the /p flag and prints the replaced lines only one 

1. To Delete a particular line say n in this example
Syntax:
$ sed 'nd' filename.txt

3. To Delete a last line
Syntax:
$ sed '$d' filename.txt

5. To Delete line from range x to y
Syntax:
$ sed 'x,yd' filename.txt

7. To Delete from nth to last line
Syntax:
$ sed 'nth,$d' filename.txt

9. To Delete pattern matching line
Syntax:
$ sed '/pattern/d' filename.txt

# awk
write tiny but effective programs in the form of statements that define text patterns that are to be searched for in each line of a document and the action that is to be taken when a match is found within a line

AWK Operations: 
(a) Scans a file line by line 
(b) Splits each input line into fields 
(c) Compares input line/fields to pattern 
(d) Performs action(s) on matched lines 

2. Useful For: 
(a) Transform data files 
(b) Produce formatted reports 

3. Programming Constructs: 
(a) Format output lines 
(b) Arithmetic and string operations 
(c) Conditionals and loops
